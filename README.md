This is my second project I have done in my Thinkful
Data Analytics course.  It focuses on different factors that affect housing
prices.  There are 88 columns and 1460 entries.

The excel spreadsheet focuses on only three variables out of the 88:
    - If the house had central air conditioning
    - If the house was in proximity to a railroad crossing
    - What season the house was sold

On these variables, I conducted t-tests comparing central air and proximity
to price while doing a z-test comparing central air to time of year.

The PowerPoint emphasizes the results taken from the excel spreadsheet.
